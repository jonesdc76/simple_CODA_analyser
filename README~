Simple example of an analysis code based on ROOT and C++
to read a CODA file, unpack the ROCs and unpack the banks,
then pick out my data and fill a histogram.

An example of how to run:

   Suppose run.dat is a link to mpd_204.dat
   The run like this
     ./newrun 204 10 > x.log
   This will analyze run #204 for 10 events and put the
   output into "x.log", a file.
   Root file is ana_204.root with one histogram in it.

Ana_main.C
    main analysis code.  It's what you mostly have to look at.
    The executible is "xana".  See also "newrun".

Makefile
    to compile, type "make"

newrun
    frontend script.  To run type "./newrun 1610" to analyze 
    run number 1610.  Obviously you'll need to control what is
    in "newrun" -- to point to your data files, etc

The rest are codes used to build the analyzer.
